This sandwich is a mainstay (i.e. all-time classic). It makes for a classy breakfast, lunch, or dinner, and is great for hosting as guests can make their own sandwiches. 

#Ingredients

* Bread sprinkled with sesame seeds
* Unsalted butter
* Fresh smoked salmon, sliced[^1]
* Lemon
* Capers
* Green onions (shallots or white onions are good substitutes)
* Olive oil
* Sea salt flakes
* Freshly ground pepper

#Instructions
Toast the bread. Finely dice the shallots and thinly slice the smoked salmon (if not pre-sliced). 

Liberally butter the toasted bread, cover with slices of smoked salmon, and sprinkle with lemon juice. Loosely cover with the diced shallots, and sprinkle with capers. Pour about 1 tbsp of olive oil onto the center of the sandwich, then scatter with some sea salt flakes and top with some ground pepper. 

This is easiest to eat with knife and fork; serve with a glass of wine or milk depending on the time of day. 

[^1]: Aim to buy fresh 'chunk' smoked salmon (and ideally never frozen since being caught) which is available at most fishmongers. You can then slice it with a sharp knife to your preferred thickness. This allows you to achiveve thinner slices than the pre-sliced variety in grocery stores.
